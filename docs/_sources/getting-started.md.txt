### Setting up remote interpreter in PyCharm

If you're using PyCharm like you should be, you can set a remote Docker intepreter. This means when you run code within 
PyCharm it will ask the Python installation within Docker to run the code. Setting up the remote interpreter is required 
to properly debug Ripcord.

Select Preferences... the PyCharm. Select  -> Project: dragon-ripcord -> Project Interpreter

```
pip install foo
```
